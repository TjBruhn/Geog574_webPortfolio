        <h2>GIS Professional | UAS Pilot</h2>

        <p>
          I love maps! In fact, I have loved maps my whole life and now I have
          the joy of making them. Whether creating clean simple visualizations,
          conducting complex analysis, or collecting data in the field by drone
          or on foot I am happy to be flexing my spatial intelligence in support
          of your project.
        </p>
        <p>
          GIS/UAS is my second career. I have extensive experience in nonprofit
          management and higher education leadership. Because of this
          background, I am uniquely suited to support projects in the public
          sector. I also grew up in a family that ran a small business and
          worked in that business throughout my young life. So while the bulk of
          my experience is in the public sector, I do know a thing or two about
          private business. Ultimately, I have a reputation for learning new
          fields and industries quickly and for my skill at drawing on my broad
          experience to develop effective solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have always been motivated by helping people and organizations meet
          their goals. I excel at designing tools and processes that help make
          your work easier. I enjoy providing mission-critical data and
          information that helps you make informed decisions. I love taking care
          of the complicated technical stuff, freeing you to do what you do
          best.

                <strong>Trigger warning:</strong> This project deals with common
                causes of death in a dark humorous manner. These causes of death
                are serious and cause a lot of pain, suffering, and grief. This
                project does not intend to diminish the seriousness or the grief
                of those affected by these diseases. The intention is to use
                humor as a means of coping with the fear of death that became so
                prevalent with the Covid-19 pandemic. If you cope through
                comedy, take a look, otherwise feel free to skip this one.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our challenge was to design an infographic that included
                bivariate maps. The topic was ours to choose. At the time I was
                having some Covid woes, and in an attempt to self-sooth and
                assess my personal risk I decided to indulge in some dark humor
                centered on the question, “Am I more likely to die of Covid or
                …?” What emerged was a March Madness-inspired infographic
                pitting the top 10 causes of death in America against one
                another for the title of #1 Killer. Of note, this was my first
                experience using Illustrator. Oh, and all those silly graphics?
                Yeah, I drew them. They won’t win awards, but I am pleased with
                them.

                This is an overview map of an imaginary bicycle stage race. This
                project began just as Russia invaded Ukraine. I had the choice
                of where in the world to set my imaginary race, and I decided I
                would use the opportunity to learn more about the region.

                I developed the custom shaded relief with custom
                colored/textured landcover. I was also playing around with flow
                maps and using lines to communicate direction and magnitude.
                Finally, I was striving for clean visual hierarchy in an
                information-dense map.

              <h3>Site Selection – Recreation Development</h3>
              <p>
                Does it ever seem like you are surrounded by wild land and yet
                there are so few trails? This question for Eugene, Oregon
                prompted this project. Eugene is known as a recreation
                community, yet there are not a lot of trails close to town.
                Eugene is a geographic oddity. It is within a 2-hour drive from
                any landscape one could want! But that means it also is a 2-hour
                drive to get to anything. Longing for more after-work trails, I
                set out to identify more areas for trail development close to
                Eugene. This was my term project for my first GIS course and
                shows the results of that analysis. At the time I had less than
                4 weeks experience in ArcMap. In hindsight, taking on that level
                of analysis with so little experience was pretty bold. And
                sadly, no, there have not been any new trails developed as a
                result of my project. Perhaps it just hasn’t landed in the right
                hands yet?

                Who doesn’t want a dream cabin in the mountains? This was my
                second GIS term project where I was challenged to find a
                location for my instructor’s dream cabin. Provided a relatively
                specific set of must-haves and an interest in figuring out
                ArcMap’s Model Builder, I set after the task of narrowing the
                possibilities. The model worked beautifully, and I think the
                sites would be nice too.

                This map of little-known Suzanne Arlie Park just southwest of
                Eugene was my third GIS term project and was created for Goshen
                Fire District. I had just started as an intern at Goshen and the
                GIS team was in a mad rush to get a wildland EMS access map
                created for well-known Mt. Pisgah. Goshen mentioned that there
                were other parks in their district that needed access maps. I
                needed a term project, so why not? This area is composed of
                unofficial social trails that no one had mapped for emergency
                response. I set up an ArcCollector map and set out to collect
                and categorize all the trails in the area. Visually, I don’t
                love this one. I was directed to make it match the Mt. Pisgah
                map and this was the symbology that was chosen for it. Despite
                my dislike for the aesthetic, the firefighters appreciate it and
                find it very functional. Still I’m itching for a redo…

                Goshen Fire was interested in having their 911 dispatch maps
                revised to help improve the way units were dispatched to areas
                in the district based on criteria outlined by the Chief. This
                turned out to be an extensive project with much analysis and
                many maps along the way.
              </p>
              <p>
                It started with a massive district-wide map, dense with features
                and designed for a meeting in which the fire chiefs would
                physically draw out boundaries and areas with unique dispatch
                needs.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was then asked to identify all the areas with addresses within
                1000 road feet (including driveways) of a fire hydrant. I built
                a network dataset, used the network analyst toolset, and
                developed a series of hydranted area maps for Chief’s approval.
              </p>
              <p>
                Having gathered all this input, I went through and recreated the
                dispatch boundaries. I prepared another large district wide map
                as well as an indexed map series showing the redrawn dispatch
                zones.

              <h3>Heceta Flight Plan</h3>
              <p>
                I was part of a team working with the US Forest Service to
                produce an orthographic map of the dunes just north of Florence,
                OR. The map would be used to identify clusters of invasive
                Scotch Broom for treatment. Navigating coastal dunes can be very
                disorienting. Five flight teams on simultaneous flights at
                similar altitudes requires good situational awareness. After
                receiving the mission brief with a rough sketch on a small-scale
                map, I created this overview map and a series of larger scale
                zone maps as georeferenced PDFs. The flight teams used these
                maps in Avenza Maps to navigate the dunes with increased
                situational awareness provided by a live track of their position
                in the mission area.

                o What does one do when they get a brand new UAS? Make a map of
                course! Having just received my brand new Autel Evo II Pro and
                gone through some test flights it was time to see what this
                thing could do. I went out to a nearby park, created a flight
                plan, and set my new tool to do its work. I brought it home and
                processed the ortho in Agisoft Metashape and was thoroughly
                pleased with the results.
              </p>
              <p>
                Up to this point all my GIS experience was in ArcMap. I decided
                that, seeing as I was playing with new things, I would also give
                ArcPro a go. I loaded up a new project and dropped in the ortho.
                I created a couple of new feature classes and digitized the
                fields and the paths. I moved on to the layout and ended up with
                a passable first foray in ArcPro.

                Do you love those incredibly precise acreage values? Don’t
                worry, I have since learned how to display more meaningful
                values. But hey, some flaws are worth keeping to remind us of
                our progress.

              <p>
                With a ground sample distance of about 1 inch, this orthographic
                map of Lane Community College has found many uses. A beautiful
                cloudless day created excellent flight conditions, a well-lit
                map, and a sunburn on my arms from holding the aircraft
                controller. I collected these images as the pilot in command
                with two visual observers. The images were acquired with Autel
                Evo II Pro aircraft. The ground control points were collected
                with an Emlid Reach2. I processed the ortho in Pix4d mapper. It
                serves as a base map for Goshen Fire’s preplanning maps of
                campus, and it has assisted campus planning in several projects.
                Note: this version is a large PDF with less resolution that the
                original.

                Do you remember your first? A time-honored question we use to
                reflect on everything that becomes important in our lives. This
                is my first map using GIS software. It has that iconic ArcMap
                feel that is nostalgic of the maps you would find in old
                textbooks. Sigh. Honestly, I am pretty proud of this this one.
                As first maps go, I think this is a winner.

              <h3>Proposed Boundaries</h3>
              <p>
                Just around the boundaries of nearly every fire district in
                Oregon there are homes that fall outside the district and are
                therefore not protected in the case of a fire. Goshen Fire asked
                me to undertake a project to identify such properties in their
                adjacent areas. I combed through parcel and address data to
                identify unprotected sites. I explored access and potential
                response times. I calculated the potential revenue that would
                result from extending protection to these homes. Once the
                potential annexation sites were identified I went through a
                process to draw new proposed boundaries for the district. I drew
                several iterations of boundaries, each using a different
                reference layer to snap to. The version that stuck was a
                combination of PLSS boundaries and parcel boundaries. This large
                map was prepared for a town hall-style meeting for residents to
                explore the proposed new boundaries. The small map was designed
                for the Board of Directors and was accompanied by a series of
                large scale maps detailing each of the annexation clusters.

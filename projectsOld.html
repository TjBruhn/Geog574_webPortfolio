      <h3>2019 Top 10 Most Deadly - Infographic</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Trigger warning:</strong> This project deals with common causes
        of death in a dark humorous manner. These causes of death are serious
        and cause a lot of pain, suffering, and grief. This project does not
        intend to diminish the seriousness or the grief of those affected by
        these diseases. The intention is to use humor as a means of coping with
        the fear of death that became so prevalent with the Covid-19 pandemic.
        If you cope through comedy, take a look, otherwise feel free to skip
        this one.

        Our challenge was to design an infographic that included bivariate maps.
        The topic was ours to choose. At the time I was having some Covid woes,
        and in an attempt to self-sooth and assess my personal risk I decided to
        indulge in some dark humor centered on the question, “Am I more likely
        to die of Covid or …?” What emerged was a March Madness-inspired
        infographic pitting the top 10 causes of death in America against one
        another for the title of #1 Killer. Of note, this was my first
        experience using Illustrator. Oh, and all those silly graphics? Yeah, I
        drew them. They won't win awards, but I am pleased with them.

      <h3>Site Selection - Recreation Development</h3>
      <p>
        Does it ever seem like you are surrounded by wild land and yet there are
        so few trails? This question for Eugene, Oregon prompted this project.
        Eugene is known as a recreation community, yet there are not a lot of
        trails close to town. Eugene is a geographic oddity. It is within a
        2-hour drive from any landscape one could want! But that means it also
        is a 2-hour drive to get to anything. Longing for more after-work
        trails, I set out to identify more areas for trail development close to
        Eugene. This was my term project for my first GIS course and shows the
        results of that analysis. At the time I had less than 4 weeks experience
        in ArcMap. In hindsight, taking on that level of analysis with so little
        experience was pretty bold. And sadly, no, there have not been any new
        trails developed as a result of my project. Perhaps it just hasn't
        landed in the right hands yet?

        This map of little-known Suzanne Arlie Park just southwest of Eugene was

        had just started as an intern at Goshen and the GIS team was in a mad
        rush to get a wildland EMS access map created for well-known Mt. Pisgah.
        Goshen mentioned that there were other parks in their district that
        needed access maps. I needed a term project, so why not? This area is
        composed of unofficial social trails that no one had mapped for
        emergency response. I set up an ArcCollector map and set out to collect
        and categorize all the trails in the area. Visually, I don't love this
        one. I was directed to make it match the Mt. Pisgah map and this was the
        symbology that was chosen for it. Despite my dislike for the aesthetic,
        the firefighters appreciate it and find it very functional. Still I'm
        itching for a redo…

      <h3>Dispatch Planning</h3>
      <p>
        Goshen Fire was interested in having their 911 dispatch maps revised to
        help improve the way units were dispatched to areas in the district
        based on criteria outlined by the Chief. This turned out to be an
        extensive project with much analysis and many maps along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        It started with a massive district-wide map, dense with features and
        designed for a meeting in which the fire chiefs would physically draw
        out boundaries and areas with unique dispatch needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was then asked to identify all the areas with addresses within 1000
        road feet (including driveways) of a fire hydrant. I built a network
        dataset, used the network analyst toolset, and developed a series of
        hydranted area maps for Chief's approval.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having gathered all this input, I went through and recreated the
        dispatch boundaries. I prepared another large district wide map as well
        as an indexed map series showing the redrawn dispatch zones.

        I was part of a team working with the US Forest Service to produce an
        orthographic map of the dunes just north of Florence, OR. The map would
        be used to identify clusters of invasive Scotch Broom for treatment.
        Navigating coastal dunes can be very disorienting. Five flight teams on
        simultaneous flights at similar altitudes requires good situational
        awareness. After receiving the mission brief with a rough sketch on a
        small-scale map, I created this overview map and a series of larger
        scale zone maps as georeferenced PDFs. The flight teams used these maps
        in Avenza Maps to navigate the dunes with increased situational
        awareness provided by a live track of their position in the mission
        area.

        Having just received my brand new Autel Evo II Pro and gone through some
        test flights it was time to see what this thing could do. I went out to
        a nearby park, created a flight plan, and set my new tool to do its
        work. I brought it home and processed the ortho in Agisoft Metashape and
        was thoroughly pleased with the results.

      <p>
        Up to this point all my GIS experience was in ArcMap. I decided that,
        seeing as I was playing with new things, I would also give ArcPro a go.
        I loaded up a new project and dropped in the ortho. I created a couple
        of new feature classes and digitized the fields and the paths. I moved
        on to the layout and ended up with a passable first foray in ArcPro.

        created excellent flight conditions, a well-lit map, and a sunburn on my

        the pilot in command with two visual observers. The images were acquired

        with an Emlid Reach2. I processed the ortho in Pix4d mapper. It serves
        as a base map for Goshen Fire's preplanning maps of campus, and it has

      <h3>Proposed Boundaries</h3>
      <p>
        Just around the boundaries of nearly every fire district in Oregon there
        are homes that fall outside the district and are therefore not protected
        in the case of a fire. Goshen Fire asked me to undertake a project to
        identify such properties in their adjacent areas. I combed through
        parcel and address data to identify unprotected sites. I explored access
        and potential response times. I calculated the potential revenue that
        would result from extending protection to these homes. Once the
        potential annexation sites were identified I went through a process to
        draw new proposed boundaries for the district. I drew several iterations
        of boundaries, each using a different reference layer to snap to. The
        version that stuck was a combination of PLSS boundaries and parcel
        boundaries. This large map was prepared for a town hall-style meeting
        for residents to explore the proposed new boundaries. The small map was
        designed for the Board of Directors and was accompanied by a series of
        large scale maps detailing each of the annexation clusters.
